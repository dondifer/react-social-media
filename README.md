# React social media project

In this project we wil use React and React context to build a simple news SPA connected to a mongoDB API which repo is allocated in this URL:
https://github.com/dondifer/mongoosee-init

## How to start

First of all we have to clone the repo in our local

```bash
https://github.com/dondifer/react-social-media.git
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dondifer/mongoosee-init.git
```

## Installation

Install all neccesary dependencies with npm in both projects, also we have to init mongoose project to be able to have the API working:

```bash
  cd mongoosee-init
  npm install
```

After installation we will connect with mongo database using next command:

```bash
  npm start
```

In console we should see:

```bash
$ npm start

> mongoosee-init@1.0.0 start
> nodemon index.js

[nodemon] 2.0.22
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Server started at port 3004
Base de datos conectada con Ã©xito
```

Note: pay attention to .config file in mongoose project it is important to set your DB configuration as well:

```bash
module.exports = {
MONGO_URI: 'mongodb+srv://<name>:<password>@cluster0-tuqrv.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
}
```

The next step is to build the react project, so we will run next commands:

```bash
  cd react-social-media
  npm install
```

After install:

```bash
  npm start
```

If all is correctly installed we could access to the project in next URL:

```bash
  http://localhost:3000/
```
